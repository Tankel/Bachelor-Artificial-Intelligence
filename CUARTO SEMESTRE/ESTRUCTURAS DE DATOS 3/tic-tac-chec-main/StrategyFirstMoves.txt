make this function to follow this strategy:

if turn is equal to 1 make the piece 4 to go to one of the corners.

0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0

1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0

0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1

Then in the second turn make the piece 3 go to the adjacent position available of the piece 1
(if is like the first board)

0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
1 3 0 0

or

0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
3 0 0 0
1 0 0 0

Then in the third turn make the piece 2 go to the adjacent position of the others two if its available in order to be alligned

0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
1 3 2 0

or

0 0 0 0
2 0 0 0
3 0 0 0
1 0 0 0

if that cant be done, then put the piece 4 in the last positon of that line 

0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
1 3 0 4

or

4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
3 0 0 0
1 0 0 0

if that cant also be done, then put the piece 4 in the opposite corner of the piece 1

0 0 0 4
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
1 3 0 0

or

0 0 0 4
0 0 0 0
3 0 0 0
1 0 0 0

if that cant also be done, then put the piece 2 in the diagonal next to the piece 1

0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 2 0 0
1 3 0 0

or

0 0 0 4
0 0 0 0
3 2 0 0
1 0 0 0

finally, if the turn is more than 4 make a random available move.
